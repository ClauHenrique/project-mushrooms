First and foremost, let us explain our actions and the rationale behind them. This article encapsulates an account of our inaugural venture into the realm of machine learning, a collaborative project undertaken as an integral part of our college studies. In this pursuit, our objective was to craft an application proficient in discerning between edible and poisonous mushrooms. To realize this goal, we harnessed the Mushroom Classification dataset and employed the unsupervised K-means method.

For the execution of this project, we opted for the Google Colab environment, utilizing the Python programming language. Additionally, we leveraged the AI development platform WandB and incorporated several libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib for graph creation, Pytest, Pickle, TensorFlow, and various functions from the Scikit-learn library.
